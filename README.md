# Continuity Tester

![](photos/assembled.png)

Ultra low-voltage and fast continuity tester. Digital multimeters are very good
at precise measurements but usually not so good at continuity testing. This
little tester solves the problem.

- **Open terminals voltage is 100 mV, short terminals current is 100 μA.**
  Suitable for in-circuit testing (keep p-n junctions closed) without the
  risk of damaging sensitive components. DMMs usually apply several volts or
  milliamps to the terminals (and not always specified).

- **Resistance-dependent beeper tones with chromatic steps.**
  Allows you to differentiate resistance by ear without moving your viewpoint.
  The range is 0–10 Ω with 1 Ω steps. DMMs usually have a pretty big threshold
  and require you to look at the screen to read the resistance, e.g. if you
  want to catch a bad connection.

- **Detects shorts of 1 ms with an ensured minimal beep duration of 100 ms.**
  Suitable for finding connections by sweeping and brushing without the risk
  of missing a beep. Gold-plated probes are recommended.

- **Auto-hold the minimal resistance.**
  Helps against unstable contacts, e.g. on dirty, oxidized, or lacquered
  boards. The hold resets when the resistance becomes greater than 10 Ω.

- **200 working hours on a single CR2032 cell.**
  Consumes 0.7 mA when on (+0.3 mA when beeping), 0.1 μA when off. After 3
  minutes of inactivity the tester switched off automatically.

- **±30 V input protection.**
  The tester should not be used on a powered circuit, but just in case.
  Also saves against charged capacitors. The input impedance of the tester is
  1 kΩ, so the risk of damaging an accidentally powered circuit under test is
  also low.
